After that many times people accept your challenge, the challenge will be automatically removed. So setting it to 1 means the challenge will expire once it is accepted the first time.\n\nFor reasons, this can only be extended to 2-player games. Maybe one day we'll find a way around that.\n\nI've done what testing I can, and everything appears to function correctly, but do let us know if something does not work as you expect or if you get some weird error. Thanks!"

        "text": "I am very excited to announce the availability of browser push notifications. Push notifications are 100% optional! Each browser/device has its own process for allowing/blocking push notifications. If you aren't getting notifications, the first thing to do is check your browser's documentation. If you're getting notifications but they are \"weird\" in some way, do let us know.\n\nWe've tried to minimize the amount of spam. There are only four types of notification (game start, your turn, game end, challenges), and later instances of the same type will simply overwrite the earlier ones, so you'll never have more than four notifications active at one time. Clicking a notification will open the associated URL, focusing you on an existing tab if one exists. And if you receive a notification while already actively using the site, you'll instead get a \"toast\" notification in the top-right corner of the screen.\n\nThere is one drawback: activating these notifications brings along with it a bunch of progressive web app stuff that can interfere with getting the most recent versions of front-end code. In some cases, a hard refresh is not enough. You'll instead need to close all Abstract Play tabs and then reopen. I don't have a good sense of how problematic this will be. I guess we'll find out together! üôÇ Thank you for your patience. Bug reports and suggestions for improvement are always welcome."

Basically, it's never advantageous to intentionally skip drawing a line where possible. This does not preclude you from drawing a single line (usually deep in enemy territory) to get access to a set of buildings. Basically, you can draw your first line anywhere, and the system will only hold you up if a second line is legally possible. Hope that's clear üôÇ Let me know if you run into any issues."

(@Samraku)\n\n* Kamikaze draws are now supported (in 2-player games only). (@Samraku)\n\n* Catastrophes can now be more easily triggered in the middle of a sacrifice chain. (@mneme)\n\n* The new click handler now registers a move when you click on a friendly ship followed by any ship or star in a different system. It used to only get triggered by clicking on the background. (@mneme)\n\nHomeworlds is the most complicated game we have. Although all unit tests and play testing have passed as expected, unintended consequences are always possible. Please let me know if anything weird happens.\n\nThanks to everybody who takes the time to report bugs and make suggestions for improvement.

Homeworlds does this too, but it hasn't lined up because of how the base render was orientated. While it really bothers the editor in me, I've altered the base render so North is at the bottom with ships pointing up, and then the auto-rotator should get things right from there. Let me know if it still doesn't, especially in 3 and 4 player games. For the record, in games that support rotation, once you rotate to where you want it, it should stay there throughout the game."

The first time you visit your dashboard or the game play page after the push propagates, you will see a blue \"beacon\" (see screen capture). Clicking it will trigger a brief tutorial walking you through the different components of the page. You will only see it once per device unless you go into the user settings screen and uncheck the \"Hide Tutorials\" checkbox. I welcome feedback on how helpful you find the content and what improvements you think are needed. I want to make it easy for new players to \"get up to speed.\" The only hiccup I see so far is that on mobile, the last screen of each tutorial won't show (the one that talks about the user settings dialog) because the log in button is hidden on mobile by default. I will have to see if there's a way around this.\n\nThank you for participating in this beta period! We launched because we wanted feedback from actual players about the features they wanted to see, and you have done that in spades.
