## Deploy

- Clone the repo.
- From the newly created folder, run the following commands:
  - `npm install` (installs dependencies)
  - `npm run test` (makes sure everything is working)
  - `npm run dist-dev` (or `dist-prod` if you want it minified; bundles everything for the browser into the `./dist` folder)
