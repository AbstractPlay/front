## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

* Fixed bug where new challenges didn't *really* start with "Random" seating selected.
* Added "info" button below the game board so players can quickly reference game information, including links to rules.
* Added "debug" button below the game board so players can easily get the developers the current game state for debugging purposes.

## [v1.0.0-beta]

Initial beta launch of Abstract Play! We're happy with the core functionality, but we are looking for concrete feedback on how to make things better. Please be generous with your bug reports and suggestions, and please be patient with the bugs you will almost certainly encounter.
