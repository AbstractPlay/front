    <description>Abstract Play is a site that allows you to play abstract strategy board games against other players on the internet. These games are not real-time, meaning your opponent does not need to be online at the same time as you are. You can submit your move and come back later to see if your opponent has moved. We specialize in offbeat, perfect information games without any element of luck.</description>

      <description>**Homeworlds:** Fixed a bug that kept some sacrifice moves from completing properly. Also tweaked some of the help text to be more...helpful. Also added a CATASTROPHE button. You can still click on the background of a system to trigger a catastrophe, but that wasn&amp;apos;t particularly intuitive. We remain committed to making things as intuitive as possible. Your feedback is warmly welcomed. The most consistent lesson of my professional life has been that what&amp;apos;s obvious to one person is likely not obvious to another!</description>

      <description>**Testers wanted for new game Realm!** This is the first time we&amp;apos;ve added a game since going live, so let me explain how this works. If you want to help with the testing, please visit &amp;lt;https://play.dev.abstractplay.com&amp;gt; and create an account. (The user accounts, game records, ratings—everything—are completely separate from the production server.) Then start some games and intentionally try to break it! I will accept all challenges. Please report any issues. Once I&amp;apos;m comfortable the code is correct and stable, we&amp;apos;ll move it over to the production server. Thanks in advance for the help!</description>

      <description>I just got a suggestion for Zendo (thank you, @Benedek). I love Zendo, but it simply won&amp;apos;t work in the infrastructure we&amp;apos;ve built here. If I can come up with a way, I will. I promise. But let me take this opportunity (a) to point people to the excellent Zendo Discord channel (https://discord.gg/gdmwPMuTyb) and (b) to point people to the *synchronous*, live-play Zendo client that I wrote a little while back: GitHub (https://github.com/AbstractPlay/zendo), **playable version** (https://www.perlkonig.com/zendo/). Just thought I&amp;apos;d put that one to bed for now. But please continue to suggest games you love! I&amp;apos;m typing like a maniac over here, as the four new games being tested attest. Thanks for playing!</description>

      <description>The Homeworlds click handler has been adjusted to make use of sacrifice actions simpler. If you have remaining actions of a particular colour, the move box will autofill with the appropriate keyword. Clicking the Pass button will correctly clear the partial entry. My testing shows things functioning as I expect, but again, this is complicated code. Let me know if something isn&amp;apos;t working as you expect.

      <description>New, more compact Homeworlds renderer is being pushed to production as we speak.

      <description>**New Homeworlds click handler now active.** Thank you all Homeworlds players, and in particular @mneme , for your concrete suggestions about how to improve the Homeworlds experience. A new click handler is now available alongside the old one. The old one only gets triggered if you&amp;apos;re entering moves in a combination of typing and clicking or if you&amp;apos;re continuing a string of sacrifice moves. Most moves, however, are now reduced to 1 to 3 clicks, as follows:
```txt
enemy -&amp;gt; ATTACK
friendly &amp;gt; same friendly -&amp;gt; BUILD
friendly &amp;gt; stash -&amp;gt; TRADE
friendly &amp;gt; system -&amp;gt; MOVE
friendly &amp;gt; VOID (the space between systems) &amp;gt; stash -&amp;gt; DISCOVER
```

The help text has been similarly updated. I&amp;apos;ve done a fair bit of testing, but there are always edge cases. Please let me know if you run into any trouble, and I remain open to further discussion on how to make things better. Thanks for playing with us!</description>

      <description>**Some more Homeworlds adjustments:**
- For non-Firefox browsers, the ships are a little closer together, to further minimize wasted horizontal space. If something weird happens in Firefox, please let me know in the #bugs channel.
- The global stash area has been made a little smaller and a little more compact.
- If you click the Catastrophe button, you now only have to click once to choose both the system and the colour. Just select a star or ship in the affected system of the matching colour. Help text has been updated.
- The new click handler will now behave as expected if you&amp;apos;ve selected a friendly ship and then hit the Sacrifice button. The Pass button now works as expected as well.</description>

      <description>A few minor changes/improvements were just pushed to production:
- User chats are now visible &amp;quot;above the fold&amp;quot; under the exploration window. The full log that includes move results is still below, but this will hopefully make it easier to keep on top of chats with fellow players.
- You can now export a PNG of the game board, in any past or exploration state, by clicking the &amp;quot;Download&amp;quot; icon below the game board. The issue is that the PNG export is not aware of the styles that are applied to the SVG, so the fonts will be wrong, and this may lead to slightly odd layout sometimes. There are workarounds, but they are very intrusive. If you use this feature and come across a board state that&amp;apos;s particularly egregious, let me know and I&amp;apos;ll see what I can do, but hopefully this is good enough for most situations.
- Some general bug fixes related to exploration and stash clicking are also included.</description>

      <description>**Testers wanted for new game Wizard&amp;apos;s Garden!** Another of the games we&amp;apos;re migrating over from SDG 1.0. A pair of wizards vye to harvest reagents in a single garden plot. You play until no more planting is possible, and whoever harvested the most wins! Because lots can happen in a reversi-style game, I&amp;apos;m trialing a new approach. Each move is presented across four boards. The top-left shows the piece placement, the top-right shows the flipping, the bottom-left shows any harvests, and the bottom-right is where you actually make your move. I can&amp;apos;t label the individual boards at this point, but hopefully it&amp;apos;s sufficiently clear. The help text tries to be helpful. In any case, interested testers can come join me on the dev server and help me try to break it. Thank you!!</description>

      <description>Nobody loves to win/lose by accident. In some games, that&amp;apos;s easier to do than others. A &amp;quot;Soandso is in check&amp;quot; indicator has been added. It can only be applied to games (a) where we can generate a list of valid moves (so no Homeworlds) and (b) we can *efficiently* detect a &amp;quot;check&amp;quot; condition (so no Fabrik). Right now that includes the following games: Cannon, Lines of Action, Mixtour (in testing), Monkey Queen, and Generatorb (in testing). If there are other games where such an indicator would be helpful, feel free to let us know. If we can, we will, but we may tell you that it&amp;apos;s not possible. For now, you just get bold text above the game board. We welcome ideas on improving things.</description>

      <description>**Testers wanted for new game Armadas!** (Tagging suggesters, @Nienna and @Samraku ). I know this isn&amp;apos;t a more traditional abstract, but my inner math nerd wanted to play. More traditional fare is on the way. 

Armadas is a miniatures-style game of naval combat played with Looney pyramids. 2-4 commanders move their fleet on an open field trying to eliminate their opponents. These sorts of games tend to have a *lot* of house rules and add-ons. I&amp;apos;m certainly open to expanding this over time, but for now there are three scenarios: (1) the default is trio against trio, (2) there&amp;apos;s also a &amp;quot;two trio&amp;quot; variant, and (3) the &amp;quot;freeform&amp;quot; variant lets players place as many pieces as they want until both players pass. This requires good-faith communication in advance.

Anyway, interested testers can join us at https://play.dev.abstractplay.com and help me try to break it. Thanks!</description>

      <description>Ty Bomba&amp;apos;s minimalist wargame Boom &amp;amp; Zoom is now available on the production server. Score by bearing your stacks off the opposing side, but you need to minimize your opponent&amp;apos;s scoring opportunities as well. Enjoy!</description>

If a game you&amp;apos;re playing has implementation notes, then the &amp;quot;information&amp;quot; icon below the game board will be highlighted. If you feel there are further notes needed, please let us know.</description>

      <description>A new, tabular list of games is rolling into production as we speak. It supports filtering and sorting, and you can also issue challenges directly from there. This new format is easily expanded. I know there is more people would like to see (like game-specific &amp;quot;tags&amp;quot;), but we&amp;apos;re not ready to go that far just yet. But more to come in this space, for sure. The names and numbers don&amp;apos;t *look* clickable, but they are and take you to the same lists of games and ratings the old page took you to. Feedback and suggestions always welcome. Enjoy!</description>

      <description>I have finally added the original 8x8 board back into Lines of Action (tagging @alek ). I won&amp;apos;t bore you with the long explanation, but in short, omitting it was a mistake that I won&amp;apos;t make again. Because reasons, the 8x8 board is available as a variant. I know this is not ideal, but *fully* repairing my error was simply going to cost too much by way of time. Again, I&amp;apos;m sorry. It won&amp;apos;t happen again. Enjoy!!</description>

      <description>When issuing an &amp;quot;open&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;standing&amp;quot; challenge, there is now a &amp;quot;duration&amp;quot; field. It defaults to `0`, which means that the challenge will remain active until you revoke it, no matter how many people accept it. But you can now change it to any number. After that many times people accept your challenge, the challenge will be automatically removed. So setting it to `1` means the challenge will expire once it is accepted the first time.

For reasons, this can only be extended to 2-player games. Maybe one day we&amp;apos;ll find a way around that.

I&amp;apos;ve done what testing I can, and everything appears to function correctly, but do let us know if something does not work as you expect or if you get some weird error. Thanks!</description>

      <description>I am *very* excited to announce the availability of browser push notifications. **Push notifications are 100% optional!** Each browser/device has its own process for allowing/blocking push notifications. If you aren&amp;apos;t getting notifications, the first thing to do is check your browser&amp;apos;s documentation. If you&amp;apos;re getting notifications but they are &amp;quot;weird&amp;quot; in some way, do let us know.

We&amp;apos;ve tried to minimize the amount of spam. There are only four types of notification (game start, your turn, game end, challenges), and later instances of the same type will simply overwrite the earlier ones, so you&amp;apos;ll never have more than four notifications active at one time. Clicking a notification will open the associated URL, focusing you on an existing tab if one exists. And if you receive a notification while already actively using the site, you&amp;apos;ll instead get a &amp;quot;toast&amp;quot; notification in the top-right corner of the screen.

There is one drawback: activating these notifications brings along with it a bunch of progressive web app stuff that can interfere with getting the most recent versions of front-end code. In some cases, a hard refresh is not enough. You&amp;apos;ll instead need to close all Abstract Play tabs and then reopen. I don&amp;apos;t have a good sense of how problematic this will be. I guess we&amp;apos;ll find out together! 🙂 Thank you for your patience. Bug reports and suggestions for improvement are always welcome.</description>

      <description>At the designer&amp;apos;s request, Streetcar Suburb has been updated to require drawing a second line if one is legal from your first line. Basically, it&amp;apos;s never advantageous to intentionally skip drawing a line where possible. This does *not* preclude you from drawing a single line (usually deep in enemy territory) to get access to a set of buildings. Basically, you can draw your first line anywhere, and the system will only hold you up if a second line is legally possible. Hope that&amp;apos;s clear 🙂 Let me know if you run into any issues.</description>

      <description>**Homeworlds** – A number of changes have been pushed to production:
- No more &amp;quot;white screen of death&amp;quot; when abandoning your home system temporarily. (@Samraku)
- Kamikaze draws are now supported (in 2-player games only). (@Samraku)
- Catastrophes can now be more easily triggered in the middle of a sacrifice chain. (@mneme)
- The new click handler now registers a move when you click on a friendly ship followed by *any* ship or star in a different system. It used to only get triggered by clicking on the background. (@mneme)

Homeworlds is the most complicated game we have. Although all unit tests and play testing have passed as expected, unintended consequences are always possible. Please let me know if anything weird happens.

Thanks to everybody who takes the time to report bugs and make suggestions for improvement. I appreciate your patience and willingness to engage in the process. Enjoy!</description>

      <description>The system already auto-rotates boards for certain games so the current player is at the bottom of the screen. Homeworlds does this too, but it hasn&amp;apos;t lined up because of how the base render was orientated. While it really bothers the editor in me, I&amp;apos;ve altered the base render so North is at the bottom with ships pointing up, and then the auto-rotator should get things right from there. Let me know if it still doesn&amp;apos;t, especially in 3 and 4 player games. For the record, in games that support rotation, once you rotate to where you want it, it should stay there throughout the game.</description>

For now, I&amp;apos;m just marking the game as &amp;quot;experimental&amp;quot; so it will no longer be available on production. It *should* still let people finish existing games. At some point, we&amp;apos;ll land on a &amp;quot;best practice&amp;quot; for this sort of situation. Let me know if you run into any issues.</description>

      <description>As a last code push of the day, I&amp;apos;m putting out two &amp;quot;tutorials&amp;quot; for trial. The first time you visit your dashboard or the game play page after the push propagates, you will see a blue &amp;quot;beacon&amp;quot; (see screen capture). Clicking it will trigger a brief tutorial walking you through the different components of the page. You will only see it once per device unless you go into the user settings screen and uncheck the &amp;quot;Hide Tutorials&amp;quot; checkbox. I welcome feedback on how helpful you find the content and what improvements you think are needed. I want to make it easy for new players to &amp;quot;get up to speed.&amp;quot; The only hiccup I see so far is that on mobile, the last screen of each tutorial won&amp;apos;t show (the one that talks about the user settings dialog) because the log in button is hidden on mobile by default. I will have to see if there&amp;apos;s a way around this. 

Thank you for participating in this beta period! We launched because we wanted feedback from actual players about the features they wanted to see, and you have done that in spades. Thank you for your great ideas and your patience as they get implemented.</description>

I&amp;apos;ve done some testing and fixed any obvious issues, but do let me know if something isn&amp;apos;t working as you expect. One thing: in the current/completed games lists, there will be some missing data in some cases (e.g., winners, variants). Those will populate correctly from here on out, but I haven&amp;apos;t gone back and retroactively fixed things yet. I will, but there are other DB changes being considered that would render that work moot, so leaving it be for now. Thanks! (I am seeing some layout weirdness. Further tweaks are forthcoming, but at least now the main migration is done.)</description>

      <description>@Game Designer, in particular @Drew Edwards (Coldsalmon): I have added peer-to-peer networking to the designer. If you don&amp;apos;t need it, you can just collapse and ignore the networking stuff at the very top. I may find a way to hide it more fully if people find it truly irksome. For those that have said they will use it ( 👀 @Drew Edwards (Coldsalmon) ), it&amp;apos;s relatively straightforward. Simply share your connection ID with friends. They enter that ID in their own browser and it will connect the two of you directly. You can then manually pass around a &amp;quot;talking stick.&amp;quot; Whoever has the talking stick is in control, and their game state is forcibly sent to everyone else. It&amp;apos;s not particularly robust, but it seems to fundamentally work. I welcome suggestions and bug reports. If you have any questions, let me know.</description>

      <description>I finally dug deeper into the configuration of our user account provider. Confirmation and password reset emails will now come from the correct domain, and email confirmation is now done by link instead of code. So regardless of how long it takes for you to receive or act on the email, everything will work as expected. You are not able to log in until the email address is verified. Please let me know if you or someone you know is having problems accessing the site. We want the onboarding experience to be as smooth as possible.</description>

      <description>It&amp;apos;s with mixed emotions that I announce that the original Super Duper Games will be shutting down permanently as of Thursday, November 30th, 2023. I will be downloading all the game records starting Monday the 27th of November. I will maintain the domain name, and a permanent landing page will be set up that will list all the games and point people to the SDG archive, already available on my Google Drive (https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0Bw8J0V9P_9hMeEJUSXE1LXRBN00?resourcekey=0-cklbEpjB9v8pAJ8C2nHRww&amp;amp;usp=sharing).

If your favourite game was not migrated, please submit a suggestion. Thank you to all the players who have been a part of the SDG community for these many years.</description>

      <description>There have been a few incidents where games are not being properly concluded in the database. We are looking for the root cause. In the meantime, if you get the error `Unable to get user data for [long string of numbers and letters]`, please don&amp;apos;t try to do anything with your account, like reset passwords or stuff like that. Simply file a bug report in the #bug-reports channel. It&amp;apos;s a relatively minor fix. Hopefully we&amp;apos;ll figure this out soon. Thanks for your patience.</description>

      <description>A notes feature has now been added (@Avri , @alek , @Samraku). Notes are private. Only you can see them. Notes are tied to games, not to individual moves. Notes disappear when a game concludes and is first cleared from your completed list. Because I had to pick a number, I&amp;apos;ve limited notes to 250 characters. That seems reasonable, but do let me know if it&amp;apos;s too restrictive. Feedback on the UX is welcome.</description>

      <description>I also now hide the &amp;quot;rotate&amp;quot; button below the board if the game is not flagged as needing rotation. For example, games like Cannon and Ordo are flagged as `perspective`, and the board is autoflipped for the second player. But games like Cephalopod and Streetcar Suburb are not, and so now the rotate button won&amp;apos;t appear for those games. In an ideal world the rotation would work 100% of the time for all games, but for games with below-the-board areas, it doesn&amp;apos;t work correctly. This seemed like a good middle ground for now.</description>

      <description>Phil Leduc&amp;apos;s game Murus Gallicus is now available on the production server. I&amp;apos;m pretty confident I&amp;apos;ve captured all the rules correctly, but it has been a long day 🙂 If you encounter any issues, please let me know right away and I&amp;apos;ll try to salvage the game.

In discussion with Phil, with the goal of ensuring the &amp;quot;best&amp;quot; version of the game is the default, here&amp;apos;s how things are configured:
- The default ruleset is &amp;quot;Advanced Murus Gallicus&amp;quot; (with catapults).
- By default, your first move is to redistribute one of your starting towers as walls on your second row.
- The standard pie rule is also available.
- There are three variants you can mix and match:
  - &amp;quot;Basic&amp;quot; reverts the game to the &amp;quot;no catapult&amp;quot; state.
  - &amp;quot;Static&amp;quot; disables the initial tower redistribution.
  - &amp;quot;Escape&amp;quot; eliminates the breakthrough win condition.

I should probably put that in the implementation notes, now that I think about it. Again, let me know if there are any issues. Enjoy!</description>

Note that you can share the URL of a node somewhere in the tree. Make sure you turn on exploration. Move trees with comments are marked by a small comment icon. Just follow the icons untill you get to the comment.
If you were playing in a completed game, there should be a &amp;quot;Publish exploration&amp;quot; button. This can be used to publish the exploration you did during the game so that anyone can see it. Note that all completed game exploration and comments are visible to anyone.

When there is a lot of exploration it might be a little slow in loading...</description>

      <description>Added some new stats and graphs to the Statistics page (it may take a few minutes to propagate):
- On the Play Statistics table, a minimalist histogram of the number of completed games over the past 10 weeks is visible. If you click on the mini-graph, a full-size graph will appear with all of the data for that game.
- A new &amp;quot;Site statistics&amp;quot; tab is available that gives you a histogram of all completed games on the site in seven-day &amp;quot;buckets,&amp;quot; and a new &amp;quot;hours per move&amp;quot; box plot will show you the spread of game speeds based on an average per game.
- Finally, on the Games list table, there is now a &amp;quot;recent&amp;quot; column that gives the number of games completed in the past four weeks. This will give you a sense of what games are being played recently.

Let me know if you see any issues or if you have feedback for other useful statistics you&amp;apos;d like to see. Enjoy!</description>

      <description>The solo playground is now available through the new Playground nav option. It leverages the built-in exploration function, so it only supports non-simultaneous games and only 2-player versions of games. You can also export any move state of any current or completed game to the playground. You only have one playground, and starting or importing a new game will replace the existing one. This feature is experimental. I&amp;apos;ve done basic testing, but it&amp;apos;s possible there are edge cases that blow things up. Do let me know. Enjoy!</description>

      <description>I&amp;apos;ve added *h*-index to player stats. This index gives the number of games you&amp;apos;ve played at least that many times. So an *h*-index of 4 would mean you&amp;apos;ve played at least 4 different games at least 4 times each. If you&amp;apos;ve played all the games only one time each, then your *h*-index would still only be 1. The maximum *h*-index is the total number of games available on the site (56 right now, I believe).</description>

      <description>After 18 years, the original Super Duper Games is now offline. There is a landing page up now that lists the games that used to be available (DNS propagation may take time depending on your area). I&amp;apos;ve maintained the local rules mirror as well. There&amp;apos;s a link there to Abstract Play and a link to a publicly shared Google Drive folder that contains all the historical SDG data, including updated PGN game reports. Let me know if you encounter any issues with the site. If your favourite game didn&amp;apos;t make it over, feel free to `/suggest` it. 

The intent is for the landing page to be available &amp;quot;indefinitely.&amp;quot; The domain is paid up through 2025, so at least that long 🙂 

My sincerest thanks to all SDGers. I hope you will find a similar home here at Abstract Play.

      <description>A few things have just rolled out:
- **Last seen indicators:** When issuing a new challenge, you can restrict the list to those active in the past 7 or 30 days. On all lists where you can accept standing challenges, an indicator appears next to the challenger&amp;apos;s name. Green means they&amp;apos;ve logged in in the past 7 days. Yellow means last 30 days. 
- **Player profiles:** *These are still very rudimentary at this point!* But you can now see a page of information on other players. Links appear in most lists, including chat logs. The page itself consists of multiple &amp;quot;cards,&amp;quot; the order of which you can change. I appreciate and encourage continued discussion of what you want to see here, and I will continue to adjust as I can. 
- **Country selection:** In the user settings screen (the cog in the top-right corner next to your username) you can now select the country you are playing from from a drop-down list. This is the only way we normalize the data entry. If your flag does not appear correctly on your profile page, please go into the settings and set it there. This is optional. You can set it to &amp;quot;Prefer not to say,&amp;quot; if you like.

Continued feedback and suggestions welcome. Enjoy!</description>

      <description>And to round out the Christmas hat trick, the East African game Bao is now available on the production server. A huge thank you to the patient and persistent efforts of our testers, in particular @Samraku  and @Nino. This is one of the more complicated games on the server (top-three, methinks), so there are bound to be hiccups. Let me know if you run into any issues. But thanks to our testers and their excellent suggestions, I think the game is in a good place. Enjoy!</description>

      <description>TLDR: You can now customize the player colours. Go to the main settings screen (the cog next to your username) and click the button Manage Palettes. Create as many palettes as you want. Then go to a particular game you want to customize and click the cog icon below the game board. Apply the desired palette.

And now some context:
- Most colours in most games are assigned by number. A palette simply provides custom colours for each of the player numbers.
- This will also affect properly assigned markers and annotations.
- Custom colours only affect *your* experience. Nobody else is affected.
- This will not work for all games! Some (like Wizard&amp;apos;s Garden) are hard coded. And others (like Streetcar Suburb) use arbitrary colours from the palette and are not in typical player order. Some experimentation may be required. If you encounter trouble or have questions, do reach out.
- Creating a palette with the same name as an existing one will overwrite it.
- If you delete a palette that is assigned to a game, the game will revert to the standard palette.
- Finally, I am *certain* there is some edge case I am missing that will blow a game up. If something goes horribly wrong, just let us know.

Enjoy!</description>

      <description>Some experimental customization features were just pushed to production:
- There is now a global dark mode available. Simply click the button next to your username. Your selection is saved per device. I am open to feedback on how to improve it, but know that there is no &amp;quot;one right way&amp;quot; when it comes to front ends. But I will do my best to maximize its value.
- You can now customize the appearance of your game boards using CSS. This is an advanced feature and is not without risk. Never inject code you either do not understand yourself or has not been vetted by someone you trust. I&amp;apos;m creating a new Discord channel specifically for discussions around customization. Join us there for more information (#customization).

I&amp;apos;ve also added links in the footer to the official BGG list of games available here and to a new wiki. Enjoy!</description>

The playground now has a &amp;quot;Random Move&amp;quot; button if you just want to play with the rules (obviously only works for games that generate move lists). A &amp;quot;Pass&amp;quot; button now appears next to the move selection drop down (a) if that game generates a move list and (b) &amp;quot;pass&amp;quot; appears in that move list. You still need to click &amp;quot;Submit&amp;quot; after clicking &amp;quot;Pass.&amp;quot; Let me know if there are any issues.</description>

      <description>To prevent hard errors when creating a palette with an insufficient number of colours, small palettes are automatically topped up with white. So if you find yourself in a game with a bunch of white pieces, it&amp;apos;s because the palette you assigned to that game didn&amp;apos;t have enough colours. Let me know if you run into any further issues.</description>

      <description>Just a heads up that I&amp;apos;m cleaning up some URLs, so the login URL will soon be an `abstractplay.com` URL. The issue is that, if you use your browser&amp;apos;s password autofill, it won&amp;apos;t automatically fill the first time you log in after the change. I apologize for the inconvenience, but this change means it will (hopefully) never change again in the future. I&amp;apos;ve already added the logo and will be making some other minor aesthetic tweaks to the login screen so it&amp;apos;s more in line with the rest of the design.</description>

      <description>I&amp;apos;m pleased to announce our first steps towards integrating Ai Ai with the site. Many thanks to @Mrraow for making adjustments to Ai Ai to support our goals. To start, there is only one supported game, but others will follow:
- The only game currently supported is Furl. To play against the AI, issue a new challenge to the player `(Bot) Ai Ai`.
- The &amp;quot;time to think&amp;quot; is hard coded to 10 seconds. Depending on various factors, it can take anywhere from 15 seconds to a couple minutes for a move to execute. But if it doesn&amp;apos;t execute in that time, do let us know.
- Just because Ai Ai can play a certain game doesn&amp;apos;t mean we can integrate it. Games with random starts (like Tintas), for example, won&amp;apos;t work.
- I&amp;apos;ll post here as new games get added. Enjoy!</description>

- **Gess**: The centres of pieces can now be moved into the gutter (not common, but is allowed) and some annotations have been tweaked to hopefully clarify things.
- **Martian Chess**: To prevent deadlocks, if seven consecutive turns have happened without a capture, then someone can &amp;quot;call the clock.&amp;quot; Once triggered, if seven further turns pass without a capture, then the game will be terminated and scored. Also, the game now ends immediately once someone reaches 18 points.</description>

      <description>A few announcements today:
- **New Variant**: A random start variant has been added to Veletas.
- **New Game**: Nestor&amp;apos;s game Onager is now available. Similar in some ways to Epaminondas with the stumbling blocks variant, in Onager you walk and leap across the board, trying to reach your opponent&amp;apos;s home row. (Thank you, @ypaul, for coding this for us!)
- **New Game**: James Ernest&amp;apos;s game Tablero di Berona is now available. This is the first AP game to include dice. I thought it was strategic enough to include, and there&amp;apos;s at least one other dice game I&amp;apos;m considering. I think a little randomness can be a good thing sometimes 🙂 I will admit that the way the dice work may take a few turns to get used to, but do read the implementation notes, and let me know if you have suggestions for how to improve things.

Thanks, as always, for participating in our little community. Let me know if you run into any issues. Enjoy!</description>

      <description>I&amp;apos;ve updated Entropy as follows:
- Annotations have been expanded to always show the previous two turns (so both placement and movement).
- The piece you just placed or clicked on for movement is now highlighted with a dot. (Background highlighting might have been preferred, but it&amp;apos;s not really possible given the vagaries of the Entropy renderer.)

To accomplish this, I had to meddle far more with the code than I would have liked. I always get very nervous when fiddling with battle-tested code. I played a test game, and everything appeared to function as I expected, but I screw things up all the time 🙂 Do let me know right away in the #bug-reports channel if you run into any issues with a game.</description>

      <description>Just want to clarify for Alfred&amp;apos;s Wyke players that the button bar highlighting has changed *in dark mode only*. In dark mode, the most recently used move is the lighter colour, and the oldest one is the darker. This is the inverse of how it is in light mode. Do let me know if you run into any issues.</description>

      <description>A new mobile-specific play page has just been pushed to production. The changes only affect small screens (&amp;lt;770 pixels wide):
- The undo button has been forced to the far right to give maximum space from the submit button.
- The page layout has been broken up into &amp;quot;cards&amp;quot; that can be moved around (well, up and down). The play page consists of five sections, which you can now order as you see fit on a per-device basis.
- This does not affect the single-player playground page.

The user names above the move tree also now link to the player profiles (@abdekker). Let me know if you encounter any issues!</description>

      <description>Also, exploration has been focibly disabled for dice games (Tablero di Berona and the forthcoming Take-Back-Toe). It never mattered because you can&amp;apos;t cheat. The dice rolls are not finalized until after you click Submit. But it could still cause confusion and posed issues to the exploration code. This seemed like a reasonable solution.</description>

      <description>Three more James Ernest games are now available:
- Hens and Chicks is a draughts-style game with two types of pieces and a unique capturing mechanic. Pieces can only move forward, and you try to reach your opponent&amp;apos;s home row.
- Queensland is a game where you try to form long, unobstructed corridors between your own pieces. Because of the second-player advantage, you play two games sequentially, switching seats. Highest combined score wins. This is the first time we&amp;apos;ve done this mechanic.
- Take-Back-Toe is a simple dice game where you try to form stacks of the same height on your home row.

Let me know if you run into any issues. Enjoy!!</description>

      <description>It has been brought to my attention that my implementation of Bao was not entirely accurate (https://boardgamearena.com/bug?id=60693). A challenge with these complex traditional games is that it can be difficult to find comprehensive rules descriptions. According to the rules, a nyumba is &amp;quot;nonfunctional&amp;quot; if it has fewer than six stones, but my implementation allowed the placement of a sixth stone at the beginning of the kunamua phase to reactivate the nyumba. This is apparently not correct for kutakata turns. So in the screen capture below, blue cannot place a stone, reactivate the nyumba, and then tax it. Instead, they would have to sow the nyumba, thereby losing it. I know this situation has come up a few times in games I&amp;apos;ve played. I apologize for the error.</description>

      <description>I&amp;apos;ve pushed some interim changes to the games list page:
- For now, at least, user-generated tags are disabled. They may come back later, but for now, they&amp;apos;ve been replaced with fixed category tags.
- There are a lot of tags, and maybe I&amp;apos;ll trim them down later, but for now there are four major sets of tags, presented in the following order:
  - **Goals:** These describe how the outcome of the game is determined (abbreviated in tag form as `G:`).
  - **Mechanics:** These attempt to describe generally how the game is played (abbreviated in tag form as `M:`).
  - **Board:** Describes the playing surface. Because so many games have a rectangular shape and connectivity, I may eventually remove these.
  - **Components:** Describes the components needed to play (abbreviated in tag form as `C:`). Since the vast majority of games are &amp;quot;simple,&amp;quot; I may eventually remove these.
- Clicking on a tag will find games that contain that tag. Clicking on multiple tags does a &amp;quot;logical and&amp;quot; function (so the displayed games contain *all* the selected tags).
- You can hover over a tag for more details.
- There are now separate search fields specifically for game name and designer.

There are many more changes I intend to make to this screen, specifically around mobile UX. Please join us in the #suggestions-archive channel if you have concrete suggestions for how we can improve the usability of this page on small screens. Feedback welcome!</description>

      <description>@Mark Khan&amp;apos;s game Clearcut has been transformed into Halfcut. The game records and ratings remain but will be flagged as Halfcut games with the &amp;quot;Clearcut&amp;quot; variant. To minimize the damage to the database, the unique identifier for this game has NOT changed. So while the display name is now &amp;quot;Halfcut,&amp;quot; the database key and URL have remained as `clearcut` (https://play.abstractplay.com/games/clearcut). It&amp;apos;s not ideal, but it&amp;apos;s far easier than the alternatives. Thanks to @ypaul for revamping the code. Let me know if something weird starts happening.</description>

      <description>Changes to the zoom feature have been pushed to production: 
- I have disabled the new zoom features on small screens because the standard pinch and zoom has always worked fine on mobile devices.
- On desktop, I have made some minor adjustments to try to maximize the space available to the game board.
- On desktop, there is now a toggle button below the game board that lets you switch the game page to the vertical/mobile layout. Vertical mode disables the new zoom feature, but it does force the game board to full screen width (this is a per-device setting).
- For the record, Ctrl++ does not work and likely will never work as you might hope. To my knowledge, there is no way around this, but if anyone out there has CSS knowledge and is able to show me how make that magic work, I am all ears.</description>

      <description>You will see that the main menu has changed a little again. Tournaments are now grouped under the general heading Events, and you&amp;apos;ll see that there&amp;apos;s now an &amp;quot;Organized Events&amp;quot; feature. This will let individuals organize one-off events of arbitrary structure and composition. I implemented this because the PerGioco folks reached out wanting to run tournaments here (https://www.pergioco.net/). They will be the first to use this new feature, and I hope we&amp;apos;ll be able to work out any kinks and make UX improvements as we go. Expect to see further announcements here as events launch. Anybody else that&amp;apos;s interested in creating events just needs to reach out to me. To keep things manageable as the feature is rolled out, people need to be authorized to create new events. 

As you interact with this feature, I welcome feedback and suggestions on how to improve things. Thanks for your continued engagement.</description>

      <description>Two new buttons now appear in the Status section of all games. The refresh button does just that. Apparently when you &amp;quot;install&amp;quot; AP as an app on some devices, you can no longer trigger a page refresh. This fixes that, at least for game play pages. The clock icon will instead trigger periodic refreshes. Every 60 seconds for 30 minutes (or until you manually refresh or leave the page, or click the button again to turn them off), the page will fetch the most recent game state. This will hopefully make realtime games a little more bearable for folks. Please let me know if something does not work as you expect. Enjoy!</description>

      <description>I&amp;apos;ve made some changes so that &amp;quot;new chat&amp;quot; indicators appear in the active game tables on the dashboard. When entering a game that has new chat, an indicator will appear on the top-right of the board section. That will persist until you leave the page. (Once you view the game page, the &amp;quot;last seen&amp;quot; updates, so the chat will not appear as &amp;quot;new&amp;quot; again.) This required some minor changes on the backend, which always scares me a little 😄 Let me know if something unexpected happens. Thanks for your patience.</description>

- In Erik Dresner&amp;apos;s game Logger, players grow and harvest trees for points. Supports 2-4 players. Moves are more complex than most abstracts, but there&amp;apos;s lots of highlighting and error messages to help.
- In Carlton Noles&amp;apos;s game Subdivision, place various types of buildings in the city to maximize your score. This is an old SDG game. There are a couple setup options for diversity. Supports 2-4 players.
- Doug Orleans&amp;apos;s game Pylon has two phases: first you fill the board with pyramids (a random &amp;quot;quick start&amp;quot; option is available), and then you build stacks. Control the most pyramids to win.</description>

      <description>The Decktet game Jacynth is now available (supports 2 or 3 players). This is our first card game and our first game that includes hidden information (but not the last). Enjoy!

A few notes on hidden information:
- Particpants will only be able to see their own hands, and observers will see none of them. The &amp;quot;cards in deck&amp;quot; display will adjust to only account for visible cards.
- Once a game is over, all hidden information becomes public. You&amp;apos;ll be able to review the game from the beginning seeing all hands.
- *Starting* a game in the playground will let you see all hands and play as usual.
- *Exporting* an active game to the playground will *not* work as you expect. It will export, but you still won&amp;apos;t see the other hands. Exporting a completed game will work fine.</description>

      <description>The old SDG version of Robo Battle Pigs is now live. Because the internals were different enough, this is the first (and hopefully last, or at least very rare) instance where a variant is treated as a separate game. This new variant is called `Robo Battle Pigs (Continuous)`. It supports 2-8 players and is the first game to allow things to proceed after someone resigns or times out.

In this version, you only issue a single command per turn (after the first), and only one order resolves for each player each turn. The game is therefore longer but more deliberate and strategic. This game has hidden information. You can see what your opponents just did, but you can&amp;apos;t see their stored order queue until the game ends, at which point all hidden information will be visible and explorable.

I&amp;apos;ve done what testing I can locally, but simultaneous games with this many players is challenging. Please let me know if something does not work as you expect, and I&amp;apos;m open to ideas for making the display more clear.

I have a number of challenges up. Enjoy!</description>

From what I&amp;apos;ve read, this is a game close to Christian&amp;apos;s heart, and it is indeed deep and rewards study. The game takes longer than one might think, so first-time players are encouraged to start with the hexhex4 or hexhex5 boards. Larger and &amp;quot;more interesting&amp;quot; boards are available (including randomized modular boards), but be prepared for a long encounter. A reminder that the single-player playground is a place you can explore new games at your own pace. Let me know if you run into any issues. Enjoy!!</description>

      <description>@Gatsby&amp;apos;s game Omny is now available ( @Drew Edwards (Coldsalmon) ). This is a generalized connection game where players try to split star cells into different regions so that no single region contains a majority of star cells. There are a lot of variants for this one. Board sizes range from 4 to 10, there are nine different star distribution scenarios (including random and freeform placement), and Adere-style captures can also be enabled. Enjoy!</description>

      <description>Just a reminder to folks that there is a #suggestions-voting channel. When I compile a list of games to code, that&amp;apos;s the list I draw from. I encourage people to take a look periodically and vote on ones they feel strongly about. There are some features there too, but ideally this list is mostly games. You can add games to the list by typing `/suggest` and hitting Enter,  then following the bot in your DMs, but if you find the bot problematic, just let me know and I&amp;apos;ll add it for you. Feature suggestions are best made in the #suggestions channel. Thanks!</description>

      <description>I&amp;apos;ve done some relatively major restructuring of the code to allow for flexibility when choosing the preselected defaults for variants. I&amp;apos;ve done a fair bit of testing, but I would be shocked if I caught *everything*. When using the playground, issuing challenges, requesting tournaments, or pairing manual events, please let me know if things do not work as you expect. Thank you!</description>

      <description>I&amp;apos;ve now also altered the game page status display so it shows the defaults as well. In the screen capture is a base Omny game with the two defaults (@Gatsby). It used to not display the variants display at all, but now it will show the implicit defaults. I&amp;apos;m sure this will bring to light various tweaks we can make to the game strings. Feel free to bring those to our attention, and we&amp;apos;ll keep our eyes peeled as well. Cheers.</description>

      <description>SDG-style &amp;quot;standing challenges&amp;quot; are now available:
- The front-facing nomenclature for challenges has been changed to simply &amp;quot;open&amp;quot; challenges (those that anybody can accept) and &amp;quot;closed&amp;quot; (ones you issue to specific opponents).
- The term &amp;quot;standing challenge&amp;quot; is now being used to refer to a longstanding request that you configure for challenges of specific games.
- At the bottom of your dashboard is a new table and button. A standing challenge works like most other challenges but also has a &amp;quot;limit&amp;quot; and a &amp;quot;sensitivity.&amp;quot;
  - The limit is the maximum number of matching active games you want.
  - The sensitivity refers to how &amp;quot;matching&amp;quot; is determined. If it&amp;apos;s set to &amp;quot;meta,&amp;quot; then it counts *all* different active games you have for that specific game type. The setting &amp;quot;variants&amp;quot; also takes into account the specific variants you selected.
- Twice a day, the system will look at all existing standing challenges. It will count up all the active games you are currently participating in that match the sensitivity of the challenge. If the number of active games is below your limit, and you have no matching open challenges already, then it will issue a single open challenge for that game + variant combination.
- You can suspend and delete the standing challenges themselves, but suspending a challenge does not automatically revoke any challenges currently open.

Let me know if something does not work as you expect or if you have any questions or further suggestions. Thanks!</description>

      <description>@logygames&amp;apos;s game CIFRA is now available. Enjoy!

The board configuration is random each game. Pieces have different move options depending on the colour of the tiles they cross. The game balances by the first player choosing what pieces they want to play and from what side, and then the second player makes the first move of the game. The game has three modes:
- **Dash:** A simple breakthrough game where you try to get more of your pieces on the opposing home row than your opponent can to yours.
- **Sum:** Same as Dash but the pieces have different values. You want the highest value of pieces on your opponent&amp;apos;s home row.
- **King:** Win by getting your king to the other side or capturing the opposing king.</description>

      <description>In the various places game metadata are listed (landing pages and the `i` dialogs beneath the boards), the people who coded the game are now listed. For both game designers and coders, if I know which AP player they are, their name will now link to that profile. (In the case where there is both an external URL and an AP userid present, then the name will link to the URL and the AP profile link will be to the `(AP)` suffix that will then appear.) Also, on player profiles, any games coded or designed will now be listed. There are lots of designers whose AP names I don&amp;apos;t know. So if you&amp;apos;ve designed a game and it&amp;apos;s not appearing on your player profile, please send me a DM and I&amp;apos;ll link the names. Thanks to @Simplicatus Games for the suggestion.</description>

      <description>We have now reached 200 games, and more are on the way! I know some feel this is too many, so I thought I might take this opportunity to clarify my goals:
- I&amp;apos;m a librarian at heart, so first and foremost I want to create a place where a wide array of abstracts can be enjoyed. I have no upper limit in mind.
- This a noncommercial, open source exercise. As long as hosting costs are covered, and someone is around to keep things going, the site will remain free to enjoy.
- Because we are not chasing growth and financial gain, and we rely on volunteer effort, that means there will be ups and downs in developer activity. We encourage continued use of the #suggestions and #bug-reports channels, and as long as I&amp;apos;m around, those will be chipped away at. (If you know of developers who also like games, please send them our way!)

We&amp;apos;re also approaching our second anniversary (May 1st). Thank you to the various @Developers  and @Code Contributors  who have generously donated time and talents, to the @Game Designers  for creating engaging rules, and to the many players who keep the community alive and whose bug reports, suggestions, and votes have helped us continue to improve. And of course thank you to Looney Labs and to a handful of individual donors who have helped ensure hosting is covered for at least the next few years. Just, thank you all ❤️</description>

      <description>If you open your user settings panel (the cog icon next to your username, either at the top-right corner of your screen or in the &amp;quot;hamburger&amp;quot; menu on smaller screens), there is now an option to disable tournament start and end emails. This has been long requested, and I apologize for it taking so long to add. It&amp;apos;s hard to validate small changes like this, so do let me know if you keep getting emails after disabling the setting. I&amp;apos;ll note that tournament starts and ends are *only* announced by email. There is no other avenue currently to know that a tournament has ended other than actively monitoring the page. Also, tournament end emails should now include a link to the tournament in question. Let me know if you run into any issues.</description>

      <description>Two changes:
- There is now a [`/play`](https://play.abstractplay.com/play) route that will immediately take you to the next game in your queue (or to the dashboard if you have no available games). This also populates the &amp;quot;next game&amp;quot; queue.
- I&amp;apos;ve tweaked the &amp;quot;Next game&amp;quot; button:
  - The number in brackets is the number of games in the queue that are *not* the game you&amp;apos;re currently viewing.
  - If you&amp;apos;re in the last game of your queue, the button will simply say &amp;quot;Viewing last game.&amp;quot;
  - Once you&amp;apos;ve submitted your move in that last game, the button will then read &amp;quot;Back to dashboard.&amp;quot; But when you click it, it does actually refresh the queue first. So if an opponent made a move while you were making other moves, clicking the button will still take you to that game directly, despite what the button text says.

Let me know if you encounter any issues.</description>

      <description>The rules to [Morphos](https://play.abstractplay.com/games/morphos) have changed:
- In the standard game, there is a third formation and a new tiebreaker. Also, no more phantom edge stones.
- In the &amp;quot;double placement&amp;quot; variant, the pie rule is now enabled (so the first player now places two stones) and the two stones must be orthogonally adjacent.
- Aesthetically, the variant names have been updated and weak empty cells are also marked.

For the half-dozen games in progress, the original rules still apply. (But let me know if something unexpected happens in one of those games.) All games that start now (including any tournaments) will use the new rules. Let me know if there are any issues. Enjoy!</description>

A scoring summary is in the implementation notes (the `i` icon below the board). Enjoy!</description>

      <description>Thanks to @mcd, Cubeo has been updated to include variants for d8, d10, and d12. One note: the move generation for Cubeo is not well optimized, and that becomes apparent in these larger games (1 second or so to apply moves in the middle game). I will try to find time to resolve this, but I don&amp;apos;t know exactly when. Enjoy, and thank you @mcd!</description>

      <description>The Decktet game [Siege of Jacynth](https://play.abstractplay.com/games/siegeofj) is now available. In this game, cards are armies attacking different segments of the wall around Jacynth. The goal is to be the force that breaks through the most wall segments. This one is less random than the other Decktet games. Lots of brain burning here, especially in the &amp;quot;Full Deal&amp;quot; variant. Enjoy!</description>

      <description>I&amp;apos;ve added a &amp;quot;Join once&amp;quot; button to the tournament page. Joining a tournament using this button means you will only be registered in the next tournament but not any later iterations. (You&amp;apos;ll know you&amp;apos;ve &amp;quot;joined once&amp;quot; if you see an asterisk after your name in the participant list, as in the screen capture.) &amp;quot;Join recurring&amp;quot; does the normal behaviour of adding you to each following iteration until you withdraw. The withdraw button has also been relabelled &amp;quot;Withdraw from next&amp;quot; to make it clearer. You cannot withdraw from a tournament that has already started (other than resigning your games).

The purpose of the automated tournaments is to keep a steady flow of games you enjoy, but apparently there is also a desire to try a new game without having to remember to withdraw afterwards. Hopefully this helps, though it does make the interface a little more cluttered. Further feedback and suggestions are welcome. Thanks for playing!</description>

      <description>Two important frontend changes are now live:
- Thanks to @mcd, the [Games page](https://play.abstractplay.com/games) and all its modules now have a grid view option. I do recognize that there are still issues with thumbnails in dark mode. Fundamental changes to the thumbnails are in the works. 
- Tournament results are now summarized in two places:
  - On the [general stats page](https://play.abstractplay.com/stats), there is now a &amp;quot;Tournament statistics&amp;quot; page. This lists all the users that have ever participated in an automated tournament and a summary of their performance, including number of tournaments, number of wins, number of top-50% finishes, and total, average, and median &amp;quot;score.&amp;quot; Your score for each tournament is a number between 0 and 100 that represents your performance (first place gets 100 points, last place gets 0).
  - On individual player profile pages, if that player has participated in any tournaments, they are listed along with the player&amp;apos;s final result, number of participants, score received, and the date the tournament ended. There&amp;apos;s also a link here to the tournament results table.

Please let us know if anything seems to be amiss. Further feedback and suggestions are welcome. Enjoy!</description>

      <description>The colour-blind palette has been adjusted. Further feedback is always welcome. I&amp;apos;ve also added a new alternate display for Entropy that adds a number to the different coloured pieces as well, to distinguish them even further. Let me know if you run into any issues.</description>

      <description>The default and the built-in colour-blind palettes have been expanded to 12 colours. For most games, the change will be imperceptible. It will be more noticeable in games like Entropy and Tintas (the first image is the original palette, the second is the new). But this change now allows us to include games with larger palette requirements. Custom palettes remain &amp;quot;a thing&amp;quot; (see the #customization channel for details). Let us know if you have any issues.</description>

      <description>Thanks to @mcd, two changes have been made on the front end:
- There is now a &amp;quot;use preferred player colour&amp;quot; option. When set and a palette is applied, then you will always appear as that given colour, regardless of the player order. For this to work, you must create a custom palette with your preferred colour first (as &amp;quot;Player 1&amp;quot;) and apply that palette to any games where you want this feature to work (see the #customization channel for details). A reminder that this type of customization is only visible to you. It does not affect other players&amp;apos; experiences.
- Also, the palette creation screen has been improved and now includes the default 12 colours as swatches.

Let us know if you run into any issues. Enjoy!</description>
